          Foveated Object-Centric Learning (FocL): Designed a multi-viewpoint foveated-vision training
          framework that improves adversarial robustness by ~61% while using 56% less labeled data and
          substantially reducing cumulative sample loss (memorization proxy).
        - >
          Developed SAM-based dorsal–ventral pipelines, boosting ImageNet-V2 Top-1 accuracy by ~7 percentage
          points and improving COCO zero-shot mAP by 3–4% through object-centric cropping.
        - >
          Built an active-vision system with ViT ventral backbones that achieves 1.75× higher robustness to
          transformer-based black-box transfer attacks on ImageNet and 1.5–2× higher accuracy on ImageNet-A.

          Proposed hierarchical models for subpopulation shift that reduce severe errors by 7.5–8 percentage
          points and improve accuracy by 1.5–2 percentage points on long-tail subsets.
