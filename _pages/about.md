**Scene Understanding · Robust Deep Learning · Multimodal Models**

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working with [Professor Kaushik Roy](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3085). My dissertation work establishes biologically-inspired vision systems for real-world scene understanding. My research develops adaptive active-vision frameworks to address practical challenges such as domain shift, long-tail distributions, and trade-offs between privacy and computational efficiency.  
Currently, I am focusing on adaptive foveation strategies for multimodal foundation models (VLMs), integrating robustness, privacy, and efficiency to enable scalable, high-fidelity perception in complex environments. 


I received my M.S. in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University, where I worked with [Professor Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/) and [Professor Soumik Sarkar](https://sites.google.com/view/scslab-isu/principal-investigator). During my M.S., I developed GAN-based methods for domain adaptation and adversarial attacks — targeting the robustness of perception models under domain shift, with a focus on driving-scene data for autonomous-driving applications.  
  

Prior to that, I earned my B.Tech in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering from [Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Institute_of_Technology%2C_Kolkata) (affiliated with West Bengal University of Technology).
