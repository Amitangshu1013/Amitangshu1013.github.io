I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working with [Professor Kaushik Roy](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3085). My dissertation work establishes biologically inspired frameworks for robust scene understanding, using active vision to mitigate the fragility of standard deep learning. By restructuring how models perceive complex environments, I address critical failure modes such as long-tail distributions, domain shifts, and generalization to rare edge cases. Currently, I am scaling these principles to efficient multimodal systems, developing adaptive foveation strategies that enable VLMs to maintain high-fidelity perception with reduced computational overhead compared to processing high-resolution inputs. Parallel to this, I am advancing privacy-preserving machine learning, using object-centric priors to mitigate the memorization of sensitive background data, ultimately advancing reliable AI agents safe for real-world deployment.


I received my M.S. in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University, where I worked with [Professor Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/) and [Professor Soumik Sarkar](https://sites.google.com/view/scslab-isu/principal-investigator). During my M.S., I developed GAN-based methods for domain adaptation and adversarial attacks — targeting the robustness of perception models under domain shift, with a focus on driving-scene data for autonomous-driving applications.  
  

Prior to that, I earned my B.Tech in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering from [Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Institute_of_Technology%2C_Kolkata) (affiliated with West Bengal University of Technology).
